# Javascript-Music-App
 An App that used Plain Javascript
 
 
Hello, I primarily used plain javascript and bootstrap in my project. 
If you want to add a new music to the project, 
transfer the mp3 of your music file to mp3 file and the image file to images file and create an object in music.js and enter 
the information in the musicList section and your new music has been added. :)
